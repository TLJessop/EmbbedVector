# ChatGPT Vector Embeddings and Pinecone Training Project

This project is a simple Python application for my training using ChatGPT (via OpenAI's API) for generating vector embeddings and how to store and query these embeddings using Pinecone.

## Overview

The primary goal of this project is to provide a hands-on learning experience for:

* Generating text embeddings using OpenAI's ChatGPT models (specifically, using the `text-embedding-ada-002` model).
* Storing and managing vector embeddings in a Pinecone vector database.
* Performing similarity searches on the stored embeddings to retrieve relevant information.
